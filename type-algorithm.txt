TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM-

3 TYPES
1) Supervised Learning algorithm
2) Unsupervised Learning algorithm
3) Reinforcement Learning algorithm

1) SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHM

* This algorithm consists of a target/outcome variable (or dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent variables).
* Using this set of variables, we generate a function that maps input data to desired outputs.
* The training process continues until the model achieves the desired level of accuracy on the training data.

* Examples of Supervised Learning: Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, etc.

2) UNSUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHM

* In this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict / estimate (which is called unlabelled data).
* It is used for recommendation systems or clustering populations in different groups. clustering algorithms are widely used for segmenting customers into different groups for specific interventions.

* Examples of Unsupervised Learning: Apriori algorithm, K-means clustering.

3) REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ALGORITHM

* Using this algorithm, the machine is trained to make specific decisions.
* The machine is exposed to an environment where it trains itself continually using trial and error. 
* This machine learns from past experience and tries to capture the best possible knowledge to make accurate business decisions.

* Example of Reinforcement Learning: Markov Decision Process
